# DevOps-Lifecycle
# Foundational DevOps Concept

# Definition of DevOps
 - DevOps combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to increase the efficiency, speed, and security of software development and delivery compared to traditional processes.
   
## Core Principles of DevOps
# Collaboration and Communication: 
   - DevOps emphasizes breaking down silos between development and operations teams.
#  Automation: 
  - Automation is a cornerstone of DevOps, aimed at streamlining and accelerating tasks.
# Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):
  - CI/CD pipelines are fundamental to DevOps, enabling frequent code integration and automated deployments. 
# Continuous Monitoring and Feedback:
  - Continuous monitoring provides real-time insights into application and infrastructure performance. 
# Continuous Improvement: 
  - DevOps fosters a culture of continuous improvement, where teams constantly evaluate and refine their processes.
# Customer-Centric Approach: 
  - DevOps emphasizes a customer-centric approach, ensuring that development efforts are aligned with user needs.
# Infrastructure as Code (IaC): 
  - IaC involves managing infrastructure through code, enabling automation and consistency.
    
### Stages of DevOps
# Planning: 
- This stage involves defining project goals, requirements, timelines, and resources needed, ensuring alignment with business objectives.

# Development: 
- Developers write and update code to implement the planned features and functionality, based on design specifications.

# Building: 
- The source code is compiled and assembled into executable artifacts, often including dependencies and configurations.

# Testing: 
- The built software is verified through various tests (unit, integration, system, etc.) to identify and fix bugs or issues.

# Release: 
- A stable version of the software is prepared for delivery, including documentation, packaging, and versioning.

# Deployment: 
- The released software is installed or rolled out to a production environment where it becomes accessible to end-users.

# Operations: 
- Day-to-day activities ensure the software runs smoothly in production, including performance tuning, user support, and incident handling.

# Monitoring: 
- Continuous tracking of the software's performance, availability, and errors to detect issues early and ensure reliability.
